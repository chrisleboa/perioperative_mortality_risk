# Project 

This is a project in collaboration with Hannah Wild to assess the use of perioperative risk mortality scores across humanitarian settings. 

The data has been gathered through a systematic literature review outlined in COVIDENCE

The folder structure is as follows

Data: contains data files -- email author chrisleboa@gmail.com for access

scripts: contains the scrips used for cleaning and making tables and figures in paper. 

They should be run in this order 
    0_config: loads packages and reads in data 
    1_Table1 
    2_Fig_1 ..... 

Each script corrosponds to a single figure or table as specified in the title of that file.
